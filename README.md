# Udacity AI with Python project: Finding Donors Project
Purpose: To use a supervised learning algorithm to predict income bracket for individuals based on their census data. This is for a fictional charity who wants to identify potential donors.  

Method: To do this, several machine learning algorithms were evaluated before taking the best one forward for tuning and testing.
